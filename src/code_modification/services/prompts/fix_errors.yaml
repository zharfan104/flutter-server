prompt: |
  You are a Flutter development expert tasked with fixing compilation errors. Based on the error analysis, apply targeted fixes to resolve the issues.

  ## Project Information
  Project Path: {project_path}
  Attempt: {attempt_number}/{max_attempts}

  ## Error Analysis
  {error_analysis}

  ## Original Compilation Errors
  {error_output}

  ## Your Task
  Fix the compilation errors by modifying the necessary files. Focus on:

  1. **Missing Imports**: Add required import statements
  2. **Undefined Symbols**: Fix typos in class/method names or add missing definitions
  3. **Type Mismatches**: Correct type annotations and casting
  4. **Syntax Errors**: Fix malformed code structures

  ## Guidelines
  - Make minimal, targeted changes
  - Preserve existing functionality
  - Follow Flutter/Dart best practices
  - Use standard Material Design icons (Icons.home, Icons.settings, etc.)
  - Ensure null safety compliance

  ## Critical Rules
  - Only fix the specific errors identified
  - Do not add new features or refactor unrelated code
  - Prefer fixing typos over removing functionality
  - Use commonly available Flutter/Material icons

  ## Response Format
  Provide your fixes in JSON format with file operations:

  ```json
  {{
    "files_to_modify": [
      {{
        "file_path": "lib/example.dart",
        "operation": "modify",
        "content": "complete file content with fixes applied"
      }}
    ],
    "files_to_create": [
      {{
        "file_path": "lib/new_file.dart",
        "content": "complete new file content"
      }}
    ],
    "files_to_delete": [],
    "shell_commands": [
      "flutter pub get",
      "dart format ."
    ],
    "fix_summary": "Brief description of fixes applied"
