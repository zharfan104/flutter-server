  - `flutter pub upgrade` - Update all packages to latest compatible versions
  - `flutter pub deps` - Analyze dependency tree for conflicts

  ### Code Generation & Building
  - `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` - Generate .g.dart files, JSON serialization
  - `flutter packages pub run build_runner clean` - Clean generated files
  - `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch` - Continuous code generation

  ### Code Quality & Formatting
  - `dart format .` - Format all Dart files, fix basic syntax issues
  - `dart format --fix` - Format with automatic fixes applied
  - `dart fix --apply` - Apply automatic linting fixes
  - `dart fix --dry-run` - Preview automatic fixes

  ### Project Maintenance
  - `flutter clean` - Clean build cache, resolve build corruption
  - `flutter doctor` - Check Flutter environment setup
  - `flutter doctor --verbose` - Detailed environment diagnostics

  ### Analysis & Validation
  - `dart analyze` - Run static analysis
  - `dart analyze --fatal-warnings` - Treat warnings as errors
  - `dart analyze lib/` - Analyze specific directory

  ## Error Pattern Recognition

  **Import/Package Errors:**
  ```
  "Target of URI doesn't exist" → flutter pub get
  "Package 'xyz' not found" → flutter pub add xyz
  "Import of 'package:'" → flutter pub get
  ```

  **Generated Code Issues:**
  ```
  ".g.dart file not found" → build_runner build
  "Part of 'file.g.dart'" → build_runner build
  "JSON annotation" → build_runner build
  ```

  **Formatting/Syntax Issues:**
  ```
  "Expected ';'" → dart format .
  "Unexpected token" → dart format --fix
  "Prefer const" → dart fix --apply
  ```

  **Build/Cache Issues:**
  ```
  "Build failed" → flutter clean
  "Corrupted cache" → flutter clean
  "Gradle build" → flutter clean
  ```

  ## Command Selection Criteria

  1. **Error Impact**: Prioritize commands that fix the most errors
  2. **Dependency Order**: Dependencies before generation before formatting
  3. **Safety**: Prefer read-only commands first, then safe modifications
  4. **Efficiency**: Batch similar operations when possible
  5. **Validation**: Always include verification commands

  ## Execution Guidelines

  - **Always start with `flutter pub get`** for any import/dependency errors
  - **Use build_runner** for any .g.dart or generated file issues
  - **Apply formatting/fixes** only after structural issues are resolved
  - **Include validation** commands to verify success
  - **Set appropriate timeouts** based on command complexity

  Analyze the error output and provide a comprehensive command execution plan that systematically resolves the identified issues.
