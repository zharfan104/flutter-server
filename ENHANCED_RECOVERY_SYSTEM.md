# Enhanced Flutter Error Recovery System

## Overview

The Flutter server now includes a comprehensive, robust error recovery system that combines AI-powered code fixes with automated command execution and iterative validation. This system addresses the previous limitations and provides much more reliable error resolution.

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Robust Architecture**
- **Dart Analyzer Integration**: Uses `dart analyze` for systematic error detection and validation
- **Iterative Recovery Loop**: Continues fixing until errors are resolved or max attempts reached
- **Command Execution**: Automatically runs Flutter/Dart commands to resolve environment issues
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every step, command, and fix attempt is logged with metrics

### üõ†Ô∏è **Command Execution Capabilities**
The AI can now automatically execute these commands:
- `flutter pub get` - Resolve dependency issues
- `flutter pub add <package>` - Add missing packages
- `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` - Generate missing .g.dart files
- `dart format .` - Fix formatting and syntax issues
- `dart fix --apply` - Apply automatic lint fixes
- `flutter clean` - Clean build cache when needed

### üìä **Advanced Error Tracking**
- **Error Evolution Analysis**: Tracks how errors change between attempts
- **Progress Metrics**: Measures recovery effectiveness and success probability
- **Regression Detection**: Identifies when fixes introduce new errors
- **Category Analysis**: Groups errors by type for strategic fixing

### üîç **Comprehensive Logging**
Every recovery session logs:
- Step-by-step recovery process with timestamps
- Command execution results (exit codes, output, duration)
- File modifications and fix applications
- Error count changes and progress metrics
- Session summary with complete metrics

## System Components

### 1. **DartAnalysisFixer** (`dart_analysis_fixer.py`)
The main orchestration component that:
- Runs comprehensive dart analysis
- Executes helpful commands automatically
- Applies AI-generated code fixes
- Validates results iteratively
- Tracks progress and metrics

### 2. **CommandExecutor** (`command_executor.py`)
Safe execution of Flutter/Dart commands with:
- Whitelisted command types for security
- Timeout protection and error handling
- Comprehensive logging of all executions
- Automatic command suggestion based on error patterns

### 3. **ErrorDiffAnalyzer** (`error_diff_analyzer.py`)
Tracks error evolution with:
- Snapshot comparison between attempts
- Progress scoring and regression detection
- Strategic recommendations for next steps
- Learning from project-specific patterns

### 4. **ComprehensiveLogger** (`comprehensive_logger.py`)
Enhanced logging system providing:
- Session-based recovery tracking
- Structured data export (JSON)
- Performance metrics and timing
- Complete audit trail of all actions

### 5. **Enhanced Prompts** (`prompts/`)
New YAML prompts specifically for:
- `dart_analyze_command_fixer.yaml` - Comprehensive error analysis with command recommendations
- `shell_command_executor.yaml` - Command selection and execution planning
- `comprehensive_error_recovery.yaml` - Complete recovery workflow orchestration
- `error_diff_analyzer.yaml` - Strategic analysis of error evolution

## Usage

### Automatic Integration
The enhanced system is automatically used when Flutter compilation errors are detected. The `HotReloadRecoveryService` has been updated to use the new robust system by default.

### Manual Usage
You can also use the system directly:

```python
from code_modification.dart_analysis_fixer import fix_dart_errors, FixingConfig

# Create configuration
config = FixingConfig(
    max_attempts=5,
    enable_commands=True,
    enable_dart_fix=True,
    log_file_path="logs/recovery.json"
)

# Run comprehensive fixing
result = await fix_dart_errors("./project", config)

print(f"Success: {result.success}")
print(f"Errors: {result.initial_error_count} ‚Üí {result.final_error_count}")
print(f"Commands: {result.commands_executed}")
print(f"Duration: {result.total_duration:.1f}s")
```

### Configuration Options
```python
FixingConfig(
    max_attempts=5,              # Maximum recovery attempts
    enable_commands=True,        # Allow command execution
    enable_dart_fix=True,        # Use dart fix --apply
    enable_build_runner=True,    # Use build_runner for .g.dart files
    log_file_path="logs/recovery.json"  # Detailed logging
)
```

## Recovery Process

### Phase 1: Analysis & Environment
1. **Initial Dart Analysis**: Run `dart analyze` to get complete error picture
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Execute `flutter pub get` for import errors
3. **Environment Check**: Verify project setup and dependencies

### Phase 2: Command-Based Fixes
1. **Smart Command Selection**: AI determines which commands to run
2. **Dependency Management**: Add missing packages, update dependencies
3. **Code Generation**: Run build_runner for missing .g.dart files
4. **Formatting**: Apply dart format for syntax issues

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Code Fixes
1. **Error Categorization**: Group errors by type and priority
2. **Targeted Fixes**: Generate precise code changes via Relace API
3. **Validation**: Check each fix doesn't introduce regressions
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor error reduction and success rate

### Phase 4: Iterative Validation
1. **Dart Analysis**: Re-run analysis after each attempt
2. **Error Diff**: Compare before/after error states
3. **Strategy Adjustment**: Adapt approach based on progress
4. **Convergence Check**: Determine if continuing is worthwhile

## Logging and Monitoring

### Session Logs
Every recovery session creates a detailed log file containing:
```json
{
  "session_summary": {
    "session_id": "recovery_1640995200",
    "duration_seconds": 45.2,
    "attempts": 3,
    "success": true,
    "commands_executed": 5,
    "fixes_applied": 12
  },
  "attempt_logs": [...],
  "command_logs": [...],
  "stage_logs": [...]
}
```

### Real-time Progress
Users see real-time updates during recovery:
```
üîß Starting Comprehensive Error Recovery
üîç Running Comprehensive Dart Analysis
‚úÖ flutter pub get (8.3s) - Resolved 15 import errors
‚úÖ build_runner build (23.1s) - Generated 3 .g.dart files
üîß Applying 8 targeted code fixes
‚úÖ Error Recovery Successful! (45.2s)
   ‚Ä¢ Errors: 47 ‚Üí 0
   ‚Ä¢ Commands: 5
   ‚Ä¢ Fixes: 12
```

## Benefits

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extensible and could support:
- **Learning from Success Patterns**: Improve strategies based on successful recoveries
- **Project-Specific Configurations**: Customize behavior per project type
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Use in automated build pipelines
- **Performance Optimization**: Cache analysis results and common fixes

## Configuration and Control

### Enable/Disable Robust Recovery
```python
# In hot_reload_recovery.py
recovery_service.enable_robust_recovery_system(True)  # Enable
recovery_service.enable_robust_recovery_system(False) # Disable (use legacy)
```

### Check System Status
```python
status = recovery_service.get_recovery_status()
print(f"Robust recovery: {status['robust_recovery_enabled']}")
print(f"Max retries: {status['max_retries']}")
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced error recovery system provides a much more robust and reliable approach to handling Flutter compilation errors. By combining AI-powered analysis with automated command execution and comprehensive logging, it significantly improves the success rate of error recovery while providing complete visibility into the process.

The system is backward compatible, thoroughly logged, and designed to handle the complex error scenarios that the previous system struggled with. It represents a major improvement in the reliability and observability of the Flutter development server.
